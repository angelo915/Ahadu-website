            advantage. Social media can be used to connect with customers and build relationships, 
            as well as gather 
            information about what people are interested in and what they're looking for from a brand .

            Twitter , Instagram and LinkedIn because  it can help them in a number of ways like Social 
            media is a cost - effective way of marketing products and services because it allows you 
            to connect with your target audience for a much lower 
            cost than traditional marketing methods such as TV advertising. 
            Social media also allows you to connect directly with your customers and engage with them, 
            providing the opportunity for you to respond to their queries and concerns in real time
